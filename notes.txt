JSON (JSON WEB TOKENS)
- To generate a token we will create a function
- We will pass this function a specific users ID we want to generate a token for
- We will return that value and set it equal to the token property when we authorize or user
- Next we will need to create a custom middleware to check that token on routes we want protected
